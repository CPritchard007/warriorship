            <h2>The Wokou</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The Wokou were a group of pirates that raided the coastlines of Japan, China, and Korea. Though the title of Wokou came from japan (wokou also means either <em>“Japanese Pirates”</em> or  <em>“Dwarf Pirates”</em>), the wokou pirates were made up of many different ethnicities.</p>
                <p>The existence of the Wokou was first reported in the 13th century, where they focussed on raiding the Korean Peninsula. The Wokou took shelter in camps that can be found in Tsushima, Iki Island, and the Goto Islands.</p>
                <h3>The Ming-Era Policy</h3>
                <p>In the 16th century, tensions were high between China and Japan, and it was through this that China halted civil trading with Japan. Due to this new policy, Independent Chinese traders would make illegal trades with japan for an increased profit. At this time, the Wokou pirates took to a new form of piracy, as they began to assist with illegal trades.</p>

                <h3>Where It Came From</h3>
                <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
