                <h3>From the Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    The effects of the Samurai (also known as the Bushi) have been seen ever since the Heian Period. The samurai were people of great strength hired by nobles or wealthy landowners to build up independent militaries. As we continue down the timeline of the Samurai, their titles begin to shift into several different forms:<BR><BR>
                    
                        <ul style="display: block;">
                        <li>Ashigaru</li>
                        <li>Wokou</li>
                    </ul>
                    <BR>
                </p>
                <h3>Samurai's in entertianment</h3>
                <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
