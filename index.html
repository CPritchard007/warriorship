            <h2>The Samurai</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>What is the Samurai</h3>
                <p>At the start of the Heian period, landowners would hire people to protect their land from the government. These people would later be known as Samurais, and would follow the bushido code for generations to come. As time moved on, the title of samurai where no longer given to those who were hired to protect there land, but to those born from the samurai bloodline. It is from here that the samurai changed; here are a few forms of samurai that lived during this period: The <em>Ashigaru</em> and the <em>Wokou</em>.</p>

            <h2>The Ashigaru</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>A New Form of Samurai</h3>
                <p>In the 17th century, the title of Samurai was only given to those who are born into a "samurai family". It is because of this that the title of Ashigaru was born. The Ashigaru is a term for standard people that were enrolled to fight for the Japanese government (the title of Ashigaru is usually translated to “Samurai of the Land”, or “Foot Soldier”).</p>
                <p>Though the Ashigaru were soldiers, most of them never saw life outside of farming and rice fields. it is due to this that the Ashigaru were usually poorly trained, making them pretty terrible fighters.

                <h3>Roles of the Ashigaru</h3>
                <p>The Ashigaru fulfilled all types of roles outside of the battlefield, including working under lords (which are held at a higher level of power) and flag bearers. These roles are given to Ashigaru that have proven reliable in battles, and in cases like Hideyoshi, some of them made big names out of themselves.</p>
                <h3>The Story of Hideyoshi</h3>
                <p>Toyotomi Hideyoshi started off as an Ashigaru, but through taking a part in the right battles, he was given the position as <em>"Hashiba Chikuzen no kami"</em> or "Lord of Chikuzen". After assisting in taking over more of japan, he was soon given the title <em>kampaku</em> or "chancelor of Japan". </p>

            <h2>The Wokou</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The Wokou were a group of pirates that raided the coastlines of Japan, China, and Korea. Though the title of Wokou came from japan (wokou also means either <em>“Japanese Pirates”</em> or  <em>“Dwarf Pirates”</em>), the wokou pirates were made up of many different ethnicities.</p>
                <p>The existence of the Wokou was first reported in the 13th century, where they focussed on raiding the Korean Peninsula. The Wokou took shelter in camps that can be found in Tsushima, Iki Island, and the Goto Islands.</p>
                <h3>The Ming-Era Policy</h3>
                <p>In the 16th century, tensions were high between China and Japan, and it was through this that China halted civil trading with Japan. Due to this new policy, Independent Chinese traders would make illegal trades with japan for an increased profit. At this time, the Wokou pirates took to a new form of piracy, as they began to assist with illegal trades.</p>
