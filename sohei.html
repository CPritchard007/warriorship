            <h2>The Monks of Japanese History</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>The Sohei</h3>
                <p>The Sohei were a type of Warrior monk that lived in the early 13th century. These monks were far from friendly, and it was because of this that many people came to fear these warriors.  The armor and weapons they used shared resemblances with that of the samurai, making them fearsome in battle.</p>
                <p>It was later that the Sohei were fought back by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was fighting under the rule of Nobunaga. The Sohei were nearly defeated by these soldiers if it werenâ€™t for most of them fleeing into the mountains during the battle.</p>
                
                <p>In retaliation for their retreat, Hideyoshi set their sights on destroying the temple that most of the Sohei worshiped.</p>

                <h3>The Naginata</h3>
                <p>The main weapon that the sohei uses is the Naginata, which is a sword attached to a long pole. This weapon is used alongside with their martial arts training that allows them to make fast, and farther ranged attacks than someone with a standard sword.</p>

                <h3>The Yamabushi</h3>
                <p>The yamabushi is a large tribe of people who lived in the mountains. Unlike the sohei however, these warriors do not push to strike fear into others. These warriors spend most of there time in the mountains, where they trained in marcial arts. These warriors usually wear the same form of samurai armor, and a sword. Due to them spending most of there time in the mountains in prayer, they are believed to be quite spiritual, and some people say that the Yambushi has special powers.</p>
