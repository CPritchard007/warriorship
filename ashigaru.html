                <h3>A New Form of Samurai</h3>
                <p>In the 17th century, the title of Samurai where only given to those who are born into a "samurai family". It is because of this that the title of Ashigaru was born. The Ashigaru is a term for standard people that where enrolled to fight for the Japanese government</p>
                <p>Though the Ashigaru where sordiers, most of them never saw life outside of farming and rice fields. it is due to this that the ashigaru where usually poorly trained, making them pretty terrible fighters.</p>
                <p>The term Ashigaru can defined as <em>"Samurai of the Land"</em> or <em>"Foot Soldier"</em>.</p>

                <h3>The Story of Hideyoshi</h3>
                <p>Toyotomi Hideyoshi started off as an Ashigaru, but through taking a part in the right battles, he was given the position as <em>"Hashiba Chikuzen no kami"</em> or "Lord of Chikuzen". After assisting in taking over more of japan, he was soon given the title <em>kampaku</em> or "chancelor of Japan". </p>
                <p>The story of Hideyoshi shows that even with very little, anything is possible if you work hard enough. </p>
